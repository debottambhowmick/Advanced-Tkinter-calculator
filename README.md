# Tkinter Calculator Application

This project is a simple calculator application built using **Tkinter**, a standard GUI library for Python. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, percentage calculations, and includes utility functions such as clear and backspace. The application features custom-styled buttons for an enhanced user interface experience.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Percentage Calculation**: Calculate percentages using the `%` button.
- **Utility Functions**:
  - **Clear (`C`)**: Clears the current input.
  - **Backspace (`←`)**: Removes the last digit.
- **Styled Buttons**: Custom styles for number, operation, and utility buttons.

## special Features
 - **Multiple oprations can be done back to back and we can see the final result.**

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used.
- **Tkinter**: Python’s built-in GUI library for creating the graphical user interface.
- **ttk.Style**: For customizing button styles.

## Button Styling

- **Number Buttons**: Light purple background (`#d1c4e9`).
- **Operation Buttons**: Orange background (`#ff7043`).
- **Utility Buttons**: Green background (`#4caf50`).
